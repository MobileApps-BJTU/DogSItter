# Phase1-Team9
What is the OTR brings to you?
A process, a feeling, an enjoyable life, and you can really see the difference you make.

The name of our project is called OTR, that means on the road. Its purpose is to encourage people to walk more. 
As we know, Today's environment become more and more vulnerable, just like the haze of Beijing, so it is urgent to protect the environment. However, As an ordinary citizen, we can't do something very professional, so we think walking is a good way for many of us to do something for the environment. 
And we find some similar APPs are boring. OTR can make walking more interesting and more meaningful for people by adding a special part——Personal Creation. Also can make people more enjoyable.

Audience:
1.People who enjoy doing exercise to keep healthy, and want to do something more interesting and more personalized while doing exercises.
2.People who want to protect the environment by just walking, and to get sense of accomplishment, then to enjoy it, enjoy life.
